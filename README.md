# IoTSmartLock

<b>This is code meant to be used for my final project, not a distributable tool</b>

<p>This repository stores the code used by the main webservice that a local MSP432 tries to connect to. Tracks lock GPS position while also communicating with MSP432 to either open or shut based on user input</p>
